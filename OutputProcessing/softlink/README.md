** The dataprocess1.py script is very limited ** <br />
dataprocess1.py is a script to calculate x,y coordinates for a time step t for every person in an output file containing information about each person. <br />
The script is limited to calculating the euclidean path between the start and end points of a trip and only really works for a highway model. <br />

visualize.m is a script that takes the output of dataprocess1.py and creates an animated scatter plot. <br />
